## Design Decisions

### Masonry Grid Implementation

#### Item Position Calculations

The masonry grid was custom-built to create a Pinterest-like layout where items are placed optimally to minimize vertical gaps between them. Here's how the item positions are calculated:

1. **Aspect Ratio Calculation**: For each photo, calculate the aspect ratio using the original width and height.

   ```typescript
   const aspectRatio = photo.width / photo.height;
   ```

2. **Dynamic Height Calculation**: Determine the display height of the photo based on a fixed column width to maintain the aspect ratio.

   ```typescript
   const height = columnWidth / aspectRatio;
   ```

3. **Column Selection**: Place the photo in the column with the least total height to balance the columns.

   ```typescript
   const column = columnHeights.indexOf(Math.min(...columnHeights));
   ```

4. **Position Assignment**: Calculate the `x` and `y` positions based on the column index and cumulative column heights.

   ```typescript
   const x = column * (columnWidth + gap);
   const y = columnHeights[column];
   ```

5. **Update Column Height**: Increment the column's total height by the height of the newly placed photo.

   ```typescript
   columnHeights[column] += height + gap;
   ```

6. **Store Positions**: Collect all positions in an array for rendering.

   ```typescript
   positions.push({ x, y, width: columnWidth, height, index });
   ```

#### Why CSS Columns Were Not Used

While CSS `columns` can create a masonry-like layout, they have limitations that make them unsuitable for this application:

- **Lack of Control**: CSS columns place items in a top-to-bottom flow within columns, which can lead to uneven distribution and excessive whitespace.
- **Responsive Challenges**: Adjusting the number of columns based on screen size is less straightforward with CSS columns.
- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Infinite scrolling and virtualization are more complex to implement with CSS columns due to lack of direct control over item placement.
- **Performance**: Custom calculations allow for optimization techniques like virtualization, which are not possible with pure CSS solutions.

By calculating positions manually, we have full control over item placement, allowing for better performance optimizations and a more polished user experience.

### Infinite Scroll

Infinite scroll was implemented using the Intersection Observer API to load more photos as the user scrolls down:

1. **Sentinel Element**: A hidden `<div>` (sentinel) is placed at the end of the grid.

2. **Intersection Observer**: An observer watches the sentinel, triggering `loadMore` when the sentinel enters the viewport.

   ```typescript
   const observer = useRef<IntersectionObserver | null>(null);

   const lastItemRef = useCallback(
     (node: HTMLDivElement | null) => {
       if (loading) return;
       if (observer.current) observer.current.disconnect();
       observer.current = new IntersectionObserver(
         (entries) => {
           if (entries[0].isIntersecting) {
             loadMore();
           }
         },
         {
           rootMargin: `${loadOffset}px`,
         }
       );
       if (node) observer.current.observe(node);
     },
     [loading, loadMore, loadOffset]
   );
   ```

3. **Load More Function**: Fetches additional photos and appends them to the existing list.

### Data Virtualization

To improve performance, especially with a large number of photos, data virtualization was implemented:

- **Visible Items Calculation**: Only the items within the viewport (plus a buffer) are rendered.

  ```typescript
  const visiblePositions = useMemo(
    () =>
      positions.filter(
        (pos) => pos.y + pos.height > visibleStart && pos.y < visibleEnd
      ),
    [positions, visibleStart, visibleEnd]
  );
  ```

- **Buffer**: An extra space above and below the viewport to preload items before they come into view.

  ```typescript
  const buffer = imageGridConfigs?.lazyLoadOffset || 0;
  ```

- **Rendering Optimization**: The `MasonryGrid` component only renders items in `visiblePositions`, reducing the number of DOM elements and improving scroll performance.

### Data Mutation and Search Functionality

#### Initial Approach with `useFetcher`

Initially, the search functionality was implemented using React Router's `useFetcher` hook:

- **Usage**: Intended to perform data mutations and revalidations in a declarative way.
- **Challenges**:
  - **State Management**: Integrating `useFetcher` with the component's state was complex.
  - **Abort Controller**: Handling request cancellation with `useFetcher` was not straightforward.
  - **Data Flow**: Managing loading states and error handling became cumbersome.

#### Custom Hook with Abort Signal

To overcome these challenges, a custom hook `usePhotosQuery` was implemented:

- **Purpose**: Manages fetching photos based on the search query, handles loading states, errors, and supports request cancellation.

- **Implementation**:

  ```typescript
  import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
  import { Photo } from "../../../domain/photo";
  import { useDebounce } from "./use-debounce";
  import { photoService } from "../../../services/photo.service";
  import { appConfigs } from "../../../infrastructure/app-configs";

  export const usePhotosQuery = (query: string) => {
    const [photos, setPhotos] = useState<Photo[]>([]);
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(false);
    const [error, setError] = useState<Error | null>(null);
    const [page, setPage] = useState<number>(1);
    const [pagination, setPagination] = useState<Pagination | null>(null);

    const debouncedQuery = useDebounce(query, appConfigs.search.debounceDelay);

    useEffect(() => {
      setPhotos([]);
      setPage(1);
      setPagination(null);
    }, [debouncedQuery]);

    useEffect(() => {
      const abortController = new AbortController();

      const fetchPhotos = async () => {
        setLoading(true);
        setError(null);

        try {
          const result = await photoService.fetchPhotos(
            { page, query: debouncedQuery },
            { signal: abortController.signal }
          );

          setPhotos((prevPhotos) => [...prevPhotos, ...result.photos]);
          setPagination(result.pagination);
        } catch (err: unknown) {
          if (err instanceof DOMException && err.name === 'AbortError') {
            // Request was aborted; no need to update state
            return;
          }

          if (err instanceof Error) {
            setError(err);
          } else {
            setError(new Error('An unexpected error occurred'));
          }
        } finally {
          setLoading(false);
        }
      };

      fetchPhotos();

      return () => {
        abortController.abort();
      };
    }, [debouncedQuery, page]);

    const loadMore = () => {
      if (pagination?.next) {
        setPage(pagination.next);
      }
    };

    return { photos, loading, loadMore, error };
  };
  ```

- **Key Features**:
  - **Debouncing**: Utilizes `useDebounce` to prevent excessive API calls when the user types rapidly.
  - **Abort Controller**: Cancels ongoing requests when the query changes, preventing race conditions and unnecessary network usage.
  - **State Management**: Manages photos, loading states, errors, and pagination internally.

- **Advantages**:
  - **Flexibility**: Easier to integrate with the component's state and UI.
  - **Control**: More straightforward handling of side effects and cancellations.
  - **Performance**: Reduces unnecessary renders and network requests.

## Performance Optimization

### Steps Taken

1. **Performance Optimizations After Test Coverage**

   - Ensured that critical components were covered with unit tests before proceeding with performance optimizations and refactoring.
   - This approach ensured that functionality remained intact throughout the optimization process.

2. **Code Splitting and Lazy Loading**

   - Implemented dynamic imports for routes and heavy components using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.
   - Reduced the initial bundle size by loading components only when needed.

   ```tsx
   // src/infrastructure/router.tsx
   import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';
   import { createBrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
   import App from '../App';

   const PhotoGridPage = lazy(() => import('../ui/pages/photo-grid.page'));
   const PhotoDetailsPage = lazy(() => import('../ui/pages/photo-details.page'));

   export const router = createBrowserRouter([
     {
       path: '/',
       element: <App />,
       children: [
         {
           index: true,
           element: (
             <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
               <PhotoGridPage />
             </Suspense>
           ),
         },
         {
           path: 'photos/:id',
           element: (
             <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
               <PhotoDetailsPage />
             </Suspense>
           ),
         },
       ],
     },
   ]);
   ```

3. **Removed Unused Dependencies**

   - Used `depcheck` to identify and remove unused packages, reducing bundle size.

   ```bash
   npx depcheck
   ```

4. **Optimized Images**

  - Implemented lazy loading for images to improve initial load time and reduce bandwidth usage. Additionally, configured `lazyLoadOffset` for lazy-loaded images, although browsers have their defaults based on network speed.

5. **Memoization**

   - Applied `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
   - Ensured that functions passed as props are memoized.

   ```tsx
   // src/ui/pages/photo-grid.page.tsx
   import React, { useCallback, useState } from 'react';
   import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

   const PhotoGridPage: React.FC = () => {
     const [searchText, setSearchText] = useState('');
     const navigate = useNavigate();

     const handlePhotoClick = useCallback(
       (id: string) => {
         navigate(`/photos/${id}`);
       },
       [navigate]
     );

     // ...
   };
   ```

6. **Virtualization and Refactoring**

   - Implemented virtualization in the `MasonryGrid` component to render only the visible items.
   - Refactored the `MasonryGrid` component by distributing React hooks into custom hooks with meaningful names, improving code organization.
   - Extracted logic into custom hooks such as `useScrollPosition`, `usePositions`, `useVisiblePositions`, etc.

7. **Minification and Compression**

   - Ensured production build uses minified code.
   - Configured the server to use gzip compression for static assets.

8. **Caching**

   - Implemented caching strategies for API responses and static assets.
   - Used HTTP headers to leverage browser caching.

   ```ts
   // In API requests
   headers: {
     'Cache-Control': 'max-age=604800', // 1 week
   },
   ```
